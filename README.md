# üß† OOPS Concepts in Java

This repository demonstrates the **core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Java** ‚Äî each implemented as a separate Eclipse project. It is designed for beginners and learners to understand how abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism are applied in real Java programs.

## üìÅ Folder Structure

### 1. **Abstraction/**

This module demonstrates the concept of **Abstraction** using abstract classes and interfaces.

#### Example 1: Shape Abstraction

* **Classes:** `Shape` (abstract), `Circle`, `Rectangle`, `Square`
* **Concept:** The abstract class `Shape` defines the structure (area calculation), while concrete classes provide specific implementations.

#### Example 2: Banking Abstraction

* **Classes:** `BankAccount` (abstract), `SavingAccount`, `CurrentAccount`, `AbstractionDemo`
* **Concept:** Demonstrates how abstraction hides implementation details in a real-world banking scenario.

---

### 2. **Encapsulation/**

This module focuses on **Encapsulation** ‚Äî the idea of hiding internal object details using private fields and public getter/setter methods.

#### Example:

* **Classes:** e.g., `Student`, `Account`, etc.
* **Concept:** Demonstrates how to restrict direct access to data and maintain control through methods.

---

### 3. **Inheritance/**

This module explains **Inheritance**, which allows one class to acquire properties and methods from another class, promoting code reusability.

#### Example:

* **Classes:** `Employee` (base class), `Manager`, `Developer`
* **Concept:** Shows how derived classes extend the functionality of a base class and override methods to provide specialized behavior.

---

### 4. **Polymorphism/**

This module focuses on **Polymorphism**, which enables one interface to be used for different data types or objects.

#### Example:

* **Compile-time Polymorphism:** Method overloading (same method name, different parameters).
* **Runtime Polymorphism:** Method overriding (subclass provides its own implementation of a parent method).

#### Concept:

Demonstrates how the same method can behave differently based on the object that invokes it.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run

1. Open the project in **Eclipse IDE** or **VS Code (with Java extension)**.
2. Navigate to the desired concept folder (e.g., `Abstraction/src`).
3. Run the `Main.java` or `Demo.java` file.

## üí° Concepts Covered

| Concept           | Description                                                         |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Abstraction**   | Hiding implementation details and showing only essential features.  |
| **Encapsulation** | Protecting data using private variables and public getters/setters. |
| **Inheritance**   | Reusing code by extending existing classes.                         |
| **Polymorphism**  | Allowing methods to behave differently based on the calling object. |
